## Constraints

- The larger problem is decomposed into things that make sense for the problem domain.
- Each thing is a capsule of data that exposes procedures to the rest of the world.
- Data is never accessed directly, only through these procedures.
- Capsules can reappropriate procedures defined in other capsules.
