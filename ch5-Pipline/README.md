## Constraints

- Larger problem is decomposed using functionl abstraction. Functions take input, and produce output.
- No shared state between functions.
- The larger problem is solved by composing functions one after the other, in pipeline, as a faithful reproduction of mathematical function composition f â—¦ g.
