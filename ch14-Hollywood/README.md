## Constraints

- Larger problem is decomposed into entities using some form of abstraction (objects, modules or similar).
- The entities are never called on directly for actions.
- The entities provide interfaces for other entities to be able to register callbacks.
- At certain points of the computation, the entities call on the other entities that have registered for callbacks.
