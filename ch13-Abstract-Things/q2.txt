Q2: Mismatch. What happens if the sort method of WordFrequency- Manager is renamed to sorted_freqs, for example? 
Explain the result in detail.

Answer :
It will cause an error(
Non-abstract class 'WordFrequencyManager' does not implement 
inherited abstract member 'sort' from class 'IWordFrequencyCounter'.)
 so to solve it we can add function sort with empty implementation 
 or rename function sort to sorted_freqs in IWordFrequencyCounter
